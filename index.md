## Joe Tierno
Joe is a graduate Computer Science student with a background in biochemistry. After getting a Master's in Biology and working in the private sector he has decided to take his skills and knowledge to Computer Science. He hopes to bridge the gap between biology and using a computer as getting software that is simple to use or models that are understandable is a challenge in big pharma.
